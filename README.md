# Music-Recommendation
This project aims to build a recommendation system for music using the Million Song Dataset and user play counts.
The goal is to recommend 10 songs to each user based on collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods.
The project involves data cleaning, exploration, algorithm implementation, and evaluation.
