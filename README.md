# Music-Recommendation
This project aims to build a recommendation system for music using the Million Song Dataset and user play counts, utilizing the PySpark framework. The goal is to recommend 10 songs to each user based on collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods. The project involves data cleaning, exploration, algorithm implementation, and evaluation, all using PySpark.

The steps involved in the project using PySpark could include:

1) Importing necessary libraries and setting up the PySpark environment.
2) Loading and preprocessing the Million Song Dataset, which may involve cleaning and transforming the data to the required format.
3) Exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and identify patterns or insights.
4) Implementing collaborative filtering techniques such as Alternating Least Squares (ALS) or matrix factorization to generate user-item recommendations.
5) Implementing content-based filtering methods, which could involve analyzing song attributes such as genre, artist, or lyrics to recommend similar songs to users.
6) Evaluating the performance of the recommendation system using metrics such as precision, recall, or Mean Average Precision (MAP).

Throughout the project, PySpark's distributed computing capabilities can be leveraged to handle large-scale data and perform computations efficiently. PySpark provides various data manipulation and machine learning libraries that can assist in implementing the recommendation system.
